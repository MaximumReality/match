## 📜 PROJECT BRIEF
Welcome to the high-stakes world of cereal logistics. **Match Module** is a standalone, offline-capable PWA (Progressive Web App) designed to simulate the chaotic growth of the Azul-O’s empire. 

Built entirely on an **iPhone 14 Pro Max**, this module utilizes **Z-Index Storytelling** to layer a living cyberpunk world between your match grid and your control deck.

## 🕹️ GAMEPLAY LOGIC
- **Merge Corporations:** Swipe to match 3 or more Azul-O's or Mochkil Puffs cereal boxes.
- **Synergy Strike (4-in-a-row):** Triggers a high-speed **Cardboard Tank Drive-By** heist across the bottom sub-layer.
- **Hostile Takeover (5+ or L-Shape):** Activates the **Oscillating Glitch Engine**, flickering the reality of the grid with a 10x multiplier.
- **The Stink Timer:** Failure to maintain productivity results in a **Ticket #404-POO**. If the litter box overflows, the system requires a manual scrub (Reset).

## 🛠️ TECH STACK
- **Engine:** Pure HTML5 Canvas / Vanilla JavaScript Chaos Engine.
- **Display:** Standalone PWA with `black-translucent` status bar integration for full Dynamic Island immersion.
- **Offline Protocol:** Service Worker `v6💩` featuring `Promise.allSettled` asset security and automatic cache-scrubbing.
- **Persistence:** `localStorage` integration for high-score retention.

## 🐾 THE CAST
- **Azul:** Quantum Physicist / Hacker Cat. The Brains operating from the sub-layers.
- **Mochkil:** Chef / Chaos Agent. Host of *Mochkil's Snack Attack* and lead tank driver.
- **The Smokin' Cat:** High-speed logistics consultant anchored to the control deck.
- **The Cardboard Tank:** Hand-drawn heavy artillery unit for rapid market expansion.

## 📁 REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
- `index.html`: The multi-layered Golden Master interface.
- `sw.js`: The `v7💩🙀` Morocco-proof offline service worker.
- `manifest.json`: PWA configuration for iOS home-screen installation.
- `/assets`: Neon-glitch cereal brands, cardboard tanks, and feline overlays.
